# Python Quiz

The Python Quiz is a short knowledge test about python for newbies with 10  multiple choice questions.
The institutions that offer python courses could apply the quiz to their students and analyze the data to see what the students have the most difficulty with. The spreadsheet can be used to generate graphs to facilitate data analysis.

# User Experience (UX)

## The ideal users for this website is:
* Users who are learning Python and want to test their knowledge.


## User stories:

* As a new user, I expetc to easily to have an idea of what the program is about.
* I want to be guided and informed how I can play the quiz 
* I want to have a clear feedback from inputs
* I want to have option either to play again or to exit the program
* I expect to restart the quiz 

## How to play:

- Firstly, the user needs to enter a valid name to start the game.
- Secondly, the user can read the instructions.
- Thirdly, the quiz will start and the user needs to guess a, b, c or d as his/her choice.
- The score increases by one for each right choice.
- After the 10 questions, the user's score will be displayed.
- Finally, the user will be asked if he/her wants to play again.

# Deployment
Gitpod IDE was used to write the code for this project and the Application has been deployed from GitHub to Heroku using the steps below with version releasing active.

## Heroku Deployment
Deployments steps are as follows, after account setup:

* Select New in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select Create new app from the dropdown menu.
* Add a unique app name and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA).
* Click on Create App.

In order for the project to run on Heroku, Heroku is needed to install the dependencies. 
* In the terminal write the following commando `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` to create a list of requirements. The list of dependencies will go into `requirements.txt` file.

The sensitive data needs to be kept secret and Heroku will build the app using the code in the Github. The creds.json file is protected in gitignore file and these credentials are needed in order to connect to API. To allow the Heroku Application to access the spreadsheet the following steps are needed:

* From the new app Settings, click Reveal Config Vars, and set the value of KEY to **CREDS** (all capital letters), and go to the repository, copy the entire`creds.json` then paste it into the VALUE field. Then click "Add". Add another KEY called **PORT** and VALUE **8000**, then click "Add".
* Further down, to support dependencies, select Add Buildpack.
* The order of the buildpacks is important, select Python first, then click "Save changes". Then add Node.js second and click "Save changes" again. If they are not in this order, you can drag them to rearrange them.
* Go to "Deploy" and select "GitHub" in "Deployment method".
* To connect Heroku app to your Github repository code enter your repository name, click 'Search' and then 'Connect' when it shows below
* Choose the branch you want to buid your app from.
* If prefered, click on "Enable Automatic Deploys", which keeps the app up to date with your GitHub repository.
* Wait for the app to build. Once ready you will see the “App was successfully deployed” message and a 'View' button to take you to your deployed link.

## Compatibility
The website displays correctly across different browsers and screen sizes.

It was checked on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. Using Safari, only the sans-serif font in the header is displayed and not the Ubuntu, but this does not affect the performance of the site.



## Solved bugs
* When the correct answers from the spreadsheet were accessed for comparison with the user's guesses, the correct answers returned a list with a list.

![Python Quiz](documentation/bug_1.png)

Fixed this with another variable accessing index zero of the list, which contains all the correct answers.

```
  answers = SHEET.worksheet("answers").get("B1:K1")
  correct_answers = answers[0]
```

* To update the sheet with username and its answers was used append, however the focus was not the username but the answers, so the append method was changed to insert for the updated sheet with the row order properly.

* Added docstring to the first line.

* The Python Quiz logo was showing up after call clear. If the user scrowlls the screen up, he/she could see the half of the logo. Fixed the function clear with print('\033c') and not using os.


The following changes or additions were made as advised by my mentor, not considered as bugs, but for code improvement:

* Used strip() on inputs to remove unwanted leading or trailing spaces.
* Better explanation of input requirements.
* Descriptive name instead of using i or j.
* Add a main function 
* Add a ``` __name__ == “__main__” ``` to control the execution of the script.
